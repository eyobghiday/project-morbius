MMAE-414 Aircraft Design for the AIAA based project at at Illinois Institute of Technology. 

##Overview
The Morbin Boys are developing an aircraft for the AIAA annual aircraft competition. The IMT-22 "It's Mobrin Time 2022" is a long-range, high-altitude, Mach 1.2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft being developed by a team of four Aerospace students at IIT.

The IMT-22 will be developed under a code black titled "PROJECT MORBIUS" from the The Morbin Boys under MMAE-414 Design Works division. This year's AIAA design competition focuses on Hybrid-electric Regional Turboprop RFP and the rules of the completion can be found at https://www.aiaa.org/get-involved/students-educators/Design-Competitions. 

The morbin boys are committed to fully minimize the direct carbon emissions from the aircraft, using a hybrid-electric propulsion system. The amount of hybridization and architecture (serial or parallel hybrid) is a design choice that the team is free to make.

For more on the rules and requirements of the design, refer to the pdf-link provided below.

##Sections.

Here you will find all the documentation, report, and scripts whether it is Python or Matlab we have used so far. Keep in mind this project will be updated, and maintained in the years to come. So beware of all the changes and progress we make as we see fit.

God Speed, 
The Morbin Boys!
